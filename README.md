# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
## Overview of Project
Create an employee data base for PH and analyze the impact of the _Silver Tsunami_
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to deliver the extent of the impact that the future retirees will have in the company; two key lists will be created:

1. The Number of Retiring Employees by Title. How many vacant position HP will have?
2. The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program. Preparing a new batch of employees to assume key roles within PH is utmost importance. 

## Results
### Number of Retiring Employees by Title

-  64% of all potential retirees are Senior Engineers/Staff; there is a high risk loosing the "know how". It is important to mitigate the impact by establishing a mentoring program

-  Surprisingly, management will remain similarly with only 2 managers out of 24 retiring; allowing management to retain the current culture of PH.
### The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

Based on age a list of eligible candidates that can mentor new employees is created. It is assumed that employees who are older have the more experience, exception cases need to be addressed one by one.

## Summary
A total of 90398 employees are potential retirees during the _Silver Tsunami_. The company has a total of 300024 empoyees, this means that 30% of PH's total workforce is going to retire in the near future.

With the current age requirement for mentorship eligibility there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments that can mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. There are only 1549 eligible candidates, it is highly recommended to revise the qualifications to become eligible to the mentorship program.
